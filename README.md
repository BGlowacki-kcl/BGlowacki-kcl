## About me

Hello! I'm Bartosz GÅ‚owacki, a passionate programmer with a love for creating innovative software solutions. My journey in programming started with a curiosity for how things work, and it has since evolved into a full-fledged passion.

Personally I love:
- â™ž *playing* chess: I enjoy the strategic depth and mental challenge that chess provides. It's a great way to sharpen my problem-solving skills and think several steps ahead. 
- â™« *making music*: Making music is another creative outlet for me. Whether it's composing new tunes or playing instruments, music allows me to relax and dive into a different world.

## Skills

- Programming languages: Python (Django, scikit-learn, tensorflow), Java, C++, basic SQL, Assembly on Arduino
- Data structures and sorting algorithms implemented with Java
- Front-end web Development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
- Machine Learning models, working and implementation in Python
- Deep learning using TensorFlow library: CNN, ANN, Computer Vision
- Solving LeetCode algorithmic problems (Python, C++)

## Smaller projects

- By working in a group of four integrating github and git language to handle the project, I created a java app using javafx library, using real-life COVID-19 data and showing it on the map, calculating statistics or creating a dynamic simulation on a graph
- Using programming technique called pair-programming I created a simulation in java using javafx library showing a possibl espread of bacterias and viruses in cells, with multiple presets and changable attributes
- I created a program using input and output of arduino board. The program was fully written in assembly. This was school project which was highly appriciated with a 100% mark and satisfying feedback.
- Implementation and inner working of sorting algorithms in java (bubble sort, quick sort, bucket sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, heap sort)
- Implementation and inner working of different data structures in java (map, hashmap, binary search tree, tree, linked list, array list, array stack, linked stack, linked queue, array queue, binary search, heap)

## Bigger Projects

### Webapp AirProject - Python Django
- I created a webapp using python django framework where a user can log in as airline / airport manager, worker, passenger and others. Database with MySQL contains numerous entities and relationships. App provides such functionality as: buying tickets, creating flights, assigning tasks to workers, viewing flights and much more. App exhibits a high understanding of the django structure and database connectivity. 
- Front-end uses HTML and CSS with some elements of JavaScript. Styling is supported by bootstrap and crispy forms. 

### Model predicting Titanic survival 
- ML-Based on input data (age, ticket type, ticket price, and others), model using decision tree classifier with accuracy exceding 90%, predicts likelihood of Titanic disaster survival, employing real database.-Usage of Pickle library to save and load model.-Usage of libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy and Mathlib.
- Usage of Streamlit library to create a user friendly input environment.

### CRUD back-end application - Python Django
- I created a simple web application in Python using Django framework. App works with default Django database and is capable of registering and loging in users, creating data, reading it, updating and deleting form system. App is hosted using Python Anywhere, the link to the webpage is here: https://bartek1301.pythonanywhere.com/

### Simulation made using - Java
- Simulation is showing a field with cells of different types changing each generation according to many rules. App exhibits understanding of programming GUI using JavaFX library.
- Projects shows deep understanding of Java language, object-oriented programming. It exhibits high level of cohesion, loose coupling and can easily be expanded with new cells and features.
